# Zero-Knowledge Oracle System on Solana

A comprehensive oracle system built on Solana that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy-preserving data validation, trust scoring, and expert incentivization.

## System Overview

This oracle system combines advanced cryptography with blockchain economics to create a secure, privacy-preserving platform for trusted information sharing. It employs zero-knowledge proofs to enable verification of data validity without revealing sensitive details, implements a dynamic trust scoring mechanism, and includes an expert incentivization plan to encourage high-quality contributions.

### Core Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Prove data validity without revealing sources
- **Trust Scoring**: Dynamic reputation system based on historical accuracy
- **Expert Incentivization**: Token economics and staking mechanisms to reward quality
- **Cross-Validation**: Anonymous verification by domain experts
- **Privacy Preservation**: Identity protection throughout the validation process

## Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Smart Contract Layer** (Solana Programs)
   - Trust Scoring Program
   - Oracle Data Program
   - Incentivization Program
   - ZK Verification Program

2. **Zero-Knowledge Proof System**
   - Proof Generator
   - On-chain Verification
   - Multiple Circuit Types (Identity, Validity, Validation)

3. **Off-Chain Infrastructure**
   - Expert Interface Portal
   - ZK Proof Generator Service
   - Data Validation Layer
   - Analytics Engine

4. **Trust Scoring Mechanism**
   - Bayesian Updates
   - Decay Function
   - Challenge Mechanism

5. **Cross-Validation System**
   - Consensus Algorithm
   - Source Anonymization
   - Conflict Resolution

6. **Expert Incentivization Plan**
   - Token Economics
   - Staking Mechanism
   - Reputation Amplifiers
