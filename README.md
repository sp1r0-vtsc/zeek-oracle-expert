zkOracle System on Solana

Zero-Knowledge Oracle System on Solana - Implementation Complete
I've implemented a comprehensive Zero-Knowledge Oracle System on Solana based on the architectural blueprint provided. The implementation includes:

System Architecture
Created detailed Mermaid diagrams for:
Overall system architecture
Data flow sequences
Zero-Knowledge proof workflows
Solana Programs (Smart Contracts)
Trust Scoring Program: Manages reputation scores with time-decayed historical accuracy
Oracle Data Program: Handles submission and retrieval of verified information
Incentivization Program: Manages token rewards and slashing mechanisms
ZK Verification Program: Verifies multiple types of zero-knowledge proofs on-chain
Off-Chain Services
ZK Proof Service: Generates zero-knowledge proofs for:

Information validity without revealing sources
Expert credentials without revealing identity
Validation correctness without revealing methodology
Trust Scorer: Implements the Bayesian trust scoring algorithm with:

Temporal decay for historical data
Consistency factor calculation
Validation success rate tracking
Trust score prediction
Cross Validator: Provides trust-weighted consensus with:

Validator aggregation weighted by trust scores
Collusion detection between validators
ZK proof generation for consensus calculations
Documentation
Created a comprehensive README with project structure and setup instructions
Implemented detailed implementation guide with:
Component interactions
API documentation
Security considerations
Troubleshooting tips
The implementation is structured with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements such as DAO governance, advanced ZK circuits, and horizontal scaling. All components work together to create a privacy-preserving oracle system with robust trust mechanisms and economic incentives.

You can find the complete implementation in the zk-oracle-solana directory, organized according to the blueprint specifications. The system could be launched by installing dependencies, building the Solana programs, and starting the off-chain services as detailed in the documentation.
