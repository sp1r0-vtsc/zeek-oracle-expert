# Praetorian Capabilities Repository

Welcome to the official open-source capabilities repository from Praetorian the cybersecurity consultancy and product company on a mission to make the world a safer place.

## Our Mission
We prevent breaches by emulating attackers. Our goal is to help organisations proactively identify and address exploitable vulnerabilities through powerful tools, research, and capabilities. This repository is part of that mission: releasing select components of our internal research and product development to benefit the broader security community.

## About Chariot
Some of the tools shared here originate from our commercial product, Chariot — a unified managed service platform that combines:

* Attack Surface Management
* Vulnerability Management
* Breach and Attack Simulation
* Continuous Penetration Testing
* Cyber Threat & Exploit Intelligence

These tools are shared with the community under the Apache-2.0 license to help improve the global security posture.

## What's in this Repository?
This repository serves as a home for:

* Open-source security capabilities developed by Praetorian
* Current focus: Nuclei templates for vulnerability detection
* Future additions: Velociraptor artifacts, standalone tools, detection rules, and more

Each capability or toolset will be documented in its own directory with usage instructions and implementation details.

* Security researchers
